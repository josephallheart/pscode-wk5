// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers



(Your pseudocode here)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

result = num%2
if result = 0, number is even
else number is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
Add numbers to Array
sort them
make three variables:
	var1 keeps track of sum
	var2 keeps track of smallest
	var3 keeps track of largest
iterate through array
	add each to var1
make var2 equal to the first number in the array
make var3 equal to the last number in the array

Print out
	"The sum of all five numbers is {insert var1}"
	"The smalleset number is {insert var2}"
	"The largest number is {insert var3}"
